== Introduction to Linux on PA-RISC ==

The PA-RISC project provides a ''native'' port of Linux to the PA-RISC architecture. The port was merged into linux-2.6 and linux-3.x mainstream Linux kernel tree.
[[PA-RISC Linux Project History]] tells how the project got started and the first steps.
Contact the [[Mailing lists]] if you want to volunteer your time.

See the [[Hall of Fame]] for a list of folks who brought you the initial 0.9x and Debian 3.0 releases.
That includes boot loader, kernel, documentation, user space programs, packaging, testing, debugging, and pulling everything together into an ISO.

== Linux distributions with support for PA-RISC Linux == 

PA-RISC Linux is currently supported by [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo Linux] and [http://www.debian.org Debian].

; Gentoo Linux:
: PA-RISC is a fully supported architecture of Gentoo Linux.<br>
: Many thanks to the smart people of the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/hppa Gentoo Linux HPPA Development team] for providing [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml Gentoo Linux installation ISOs available for download]!
: If you wish to install Gentoo Linux for PA-RISC, we suggest that your read the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-hppa.xml Handbook on how to install Gentoo Linux for PA-RISC].

; Debian Linux:
: The PA-RISC Linux development community is proud to have been officially part of the Debian 3.1 (sarge), 4.0 (etch) and 5.0 (lenny) releases.
: In July 2011, PA-RISC Linux was dropped as an officially supported platform from Debian 6.0 (squeeze).  Subsequently, it became a non-release architecture in the [http://www.debian-ports.org Debian Ports] project.
: Helge Deller and John David Anglin set up several package build servers for Debian Ports.  Overtime, this infrastructure has been improved and it now uses the same wanna-build system as the release architectures.
: Kernel and tool chain support was also improved with the transition to Debian Ports. For example, the glibc source can now be built directly from source.
: Today, Debian Linux for PA-RISC is usable and stable.  More than 11,500 Debian packages are available.
: If you plan to install Debian Linux, please read [[Debian Ports Installation | this Wiki on how to install Debian Linux]], and download one install image from this list:
